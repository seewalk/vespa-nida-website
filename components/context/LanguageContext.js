    a1: "Vespa motorolerio nuomą Nidoje, Lietuvoje galite lengvai užsisakyti per mūsų internetinę rezervacijos sistemą šioje svetainėje, telefonu +3706 795 6380 arba el. paštu info@vespanida.lt. Esame Kuršių nerijos širdyje ir aptarnaujame visą Nidos rajoną. Rekomenduojame rezervuoti iš anksto, ypač Baltijos vasaros sezono metu (birželis-rugpjūtis).",
    a2: "Vespa nuomos atšaukimams Nidoje, atliekamiem likus mažiausiai 48 valandoms iki numatyto paėmimo laiko, gausite visą grąžinamą sumą. Atšaukimams per 48 valandas taikomas 25% atšaukimo mokestis. Neatvykusiems arba atšaukusiems nuomos dieną pinigai negrąžinami. Ši tvarka užtikrina sąžiningą prieinamumą visiems Nidos lankytojams.",
    a3: "Vespa nuomai Nidoje, Lietuvoje jums reikės: galiojančio vairuotojo pažymėjimo (AM, A1, A2, A arba B kategorijos), galiojančio asmens tapatybės dokumento ar paso ir kredito kortelės užstatui. Tarptautiniams Lietuvos lankytojams reikalingas tarptautinis vairuotojo pažymėjimas kartu su originaliu pažymėjimu, jei jis nėra lotyniškais rašmenimis.",
    a4: "Taip, minimali amžiaus riba mūsų Vespa nuomai Nidoje yra 21 metai, ir turite turėti galiojantį vairuotojo pažymėjimą bent 1 metus. Šis amžiaus reikalavimas užtikrina saugų Kuršių nerijos vaizdingų maršrutų tyrinėjimą.",
    a5: "Taip, visoms Vespa nuomoms Nidoje nemokamai suteikiame DOT sertifikuotus šalmus vairuotojui ir keleiviui. Taip pat siūlome papildomai išsinuomoti atšvaitines liemenes ir pirštines, užtikrindami jūsų saugumą tyrinėjant gražų Lietuvos pajūrį.",
    a6: "Vespa nuomos užstatas Nidoje yra 500 € ir bus iš anksto patvirtintas jūsų kreditinėje kortelėje paėmimo metu. Ši suma visiškai grąžinama grąžinus Vespa pradinės būklės. Tai įprasta praktika aukščiausios klasės motorolerių nuomai Lietuvoje.",
    a7: "Ankstesnė patirtis Vespa nuomai Nidoje nebūtina, bet mes siūlome trumpą orientaciją ir valdymo patarimus prieš tyrinėjant Kuršių neriją. Jei anksčiau niekada nevairavote motorolerio, rekomenduojame keletą minučių pasitreniruoti mūsų numatytoje vietoje prieš išvykstant atrasti Nidos patrauklumą.",
    a8: "Bet kokie jūsų Vespa nuomos Nidoje pažeidimai, viršijantys įprastą nusidėvėjimą, bus įvertinti ir gali būti padengti užstatu. Rekomenduojame prieš išvykstant nufotografuoti motorolerį. Jūsų ramybei siūlome papildomą pažeidimų draudimą už 15 €/dieną, kuris sumažina jūsų atsakomybę tyrinėjant vaizdingas trasas aplink Nidą ir Kuršių neriją."
